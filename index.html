I'm an astrophysics PhD student at UCL, studying dust and molecules in the interstellar medium.
More specifically, I'm currently working on dust emission from supernova remnants, and the implications for dust production in galaxies.
I'm also interested in using molecular emission from pre- and post-stellar objects to diagnose their physical characteristics.
