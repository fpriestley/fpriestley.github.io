I'm a postdoc at Cardiff University, where my main job is modelling the growth of filaments due to cloud collisions in the context of star formation.
Other research interests include tracing the chemical evolution of collapsing prestellar cores, determining the properties of dust in supernova remnants from infrared spectral energy distributions, and modelling molecular line emission in ionizaed nebulae.
My CV can be found <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cv.pdf">here</a>.
