I'm a postdoc at Cardiff University, where I work on MHD simulations of star-forming filaments and cores and their chemical evolution.
I'm also interested in supernovae, dust and dusty supernovae, and in a past life I worked on molecular emission from ionized nebulae.
My CV can be found <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cv.pdf">here</a>.
