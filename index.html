I'm a postdoc at Cardiff University, where I work on simulating the astrochemical evolution of molecular clouds and cores.
In a past life, I also worked on the lifecycle of interstellar dust, particularly the role of core-collapse supernovae.
My CV can be found <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/cv.pdf">here</a>.
