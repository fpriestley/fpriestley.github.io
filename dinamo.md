DINAMO (DINAMO Is Not A MOdified blackbody) is a dust heating and emission code described in Priestley, Barlow & De Looze (in prep).
The source code is available [here](https://github.com/fpriestley/dinamo). DINAMO includes heating by the radiation field, electrons 
and atoms/ions, and calculates the equilibrium temperature distribution for each grain size considered, and the emitted spectral 
energy distribution. The code is designed to be quite flexible, and can treat essentially arbitrary radiation fields, grain 
types, physical conditions and so on, as long as optical data for the dust species are available.
