### Determining the dust properties of supernova remnants

Blackbody fits to the infrared (IR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of nearby supernova remnants (SNRs) suggest that a significant amount of dust is present in the ejecta of many objects. However, the location and properties of this dust are often unknown. My recent work has involved producing physically motivated models of dust emission in SNRs, based on the observed gas properties and radiation fields, in order to extract more information from the available data.

A four-component model of Cassiopeia A, accounting for shocked and unshocked clumps and the diffuse, X-ray emitting gas, confirms that the majority of the dust mass (~0.6 Msun) is in the unshocked component. Based on estimated gas masses, the high (>0.1) dust-to-gas mass ratios in the clumped components indicate that a) the condensation efficiency of the ejecta is high, and b) a significant fraction of dust  located in clumps can survive the reverse shock. With the exception of the 21 micron point, several types of magnesium silicate grains reproduce the entire SED, while the mass in carbon grains constrained to be <25% of the total.

The Crab Nebula shows no evidence for a reverse shock, so can be treated as a single component heated by the synchrotron emission from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN). By simultaneously fitting the SED with model spectra for grains of different sizes, the grain size distribution can be measured directly. The size distribution is significantly steeper than in the interstellar medium, and extends to larger sizes, with more than 50% of the dust mass in micron-sized grains, with similar results found for four other PWNe with suitable data available. These large grains are expected to be resistant to destruction by sputtering in any subsequently developing reverse shock, suggesting that the surviving fraction may be much higher than previous assumed.

### Hydride ions in ionized nebulae

I previously worked on modelling the molecular emission lines detected in the Crab Nebula and a number of planetary nebulae (PNe), using a combination of photoionization and photodissociation region (PDR) codes to predict line strengths. The relative strengths of the ArH+ and OH+ lines in the Crab Nebula can be used to constrain the cosmic ray ionization rate, which is confirmed to be at least 10^7 times the interstellar value, while our models succesfully explained the observed trend in OH+ emission with stellar temperature in PWNe as being due to the increased ionizing ultraviolet flux at higher temperatures.
