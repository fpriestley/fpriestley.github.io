### Star formation

Most of my work on star formation involves trying to connect the predictions of theoretical models to what actually gets observed by telescopes, primarily molecular line emission. Synthetic observations, the result of combining hydrodynamics, chemistry and radiative transfer, can be compared directly with observational data, which is much easier than trying to use the data to work out the underlying physical properties of whatever is being observed. The aim is to extract hard predictions from the various competing theories of star formation: if x happens, then molecular line data should look like y.

### Dust, supernovae, dusty supernovae

Core-collapse supernovae are known to produce large masses of dust. However, it is commonly thought that this still isn't enough to explain the observed dust masses in galaxies, particularly as they also destroy dust, and therefore additional dust formation in the interstellar medium is required. My work on this is split into two parts: using infrared observations of supernova remnants to tie down some of the many unknowns going into models of dust evolution, such as destruction efficiencies; and reevaluating the underlying assumptions of these models, which often neglect important physical processes.
