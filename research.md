### Star formation

Most of my work on star formation involves trying to connect simulations of molecular clouds and prestellar cores to directly observable properties. Star-forming regions are typically observed in molecular lines and dust continuum emission, whereas hydrodynamical simulations output the density, which has to be inferred observationally via assumptions about the gas properties. By post-processing simulation results with time-dependent chemical networks and radiative transfer models, the resulting intensities can be directly compared to the data. I'm using this to investigate how the filamentary structures frequently seen in molecular clouds are formed, and the importance of magnetic fields in the collapse of dense cores to protostellar objects.

### Dust in supernovae and supernova remnants

Supernovae are known to both form and destroy dust in the interstellar medium, and might be the dominant mechanism for both processes, particularly at high redshift. I've been calculating dust temperatures and emissivities based on the known physical conditions in supernova remnants, rather than treating the temperature as a free parameter, which results in much better constrained models when fitting the infrared emission. This enables a more detailed investigation of the dust composition and size distribution, and estimatation of the formation and destruction efficiency with relatively few assumptions about the underlying physics.
