### Dust emission from Cassiopeia A

I've been modelling the dust spectral energy distribution (SED) from the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant (SNR) by calculating the emission from dust grains heated by the ambient gas and radiation field, for the different components present in the SNR (unshocked ejecta, optical/IR line emitting clumps, X-ray emitting diffuse gas). Fitting the observed SED with the model spectra gives a total dust mass of ~0.6 Msun of silicate grains, most of which is in the unshocked ejecta. From estimates of the component gas masses, it appears that dust is protected from destruction by the reverse shock in the clumps, but is mostly destroyed in the diffuse gas, and that the condensation efficiency in the ejecta is high (~20% of the mass in dust grains).

### Hydride ions in stellar remnants

I used a combination of photoionization and photodissociation region (PDR) modelling to determine the origin of the ArH+ emission detected in the Crab Nebula. The observed Herschel SPIRE FTS spectra require a massively enhanced cosmic ray ionization rate (~10^7x interstellar) to explain the lack of \[C I\] lines, and the relative strength of the ArH+ and OH+ lines additionally require an ArH+ dissociative recombination rate much lower than experimental upper limits. This was subsequently confirmed by theoretical calculations.

Applying the same techniques to planetary nebulae (PNe), I was able to explain the observed relation between the detection of OH+ lines and central star temperature, and the connection with molecular hydrogen emission. The emission from both species originates from the surfaces of knots in the PNe exposed to the ionizing ultraviolet (UV) flux from the central star, leading to high temperatures and ionization fractions. Molecular hydrogen emission from some PNe seems to be higher than can be explained by the UV flux alone - this could be a sign of shock heating, or some other mechanical source of heating.
