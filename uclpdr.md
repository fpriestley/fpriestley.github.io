UCL_PDR is an open-source 1D PDR code, written by Tom Bell and eventually inherited by me. The code can deal with arbitrary chemical networks, X-rays, line emission for any atom, molecule or ion for which collisional excitation rates are available and includes various other features described in [this paper](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.472.4444P). The source code is available [here](https://uclchem.github.io/uclpdr.html). As the designated person in charge of maintaining the code, feel free to send any questions my way - a basic (somewhat UCL-centric) guide to installing and running the code is available [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/uclpdr.pdf).
